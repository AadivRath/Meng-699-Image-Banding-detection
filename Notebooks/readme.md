- These notebooks were explored for selection of correct threshold value, as our dataset was unabalanced for banded vs nonbanded predictions.
**refer Dataset folder for the distribution of dataset with ratios for each class**

- Following links show the code used for threshold explorations after we trained the CNN_model for banded vs nonbanded patch predictions.

  The Precision, Recall, and F1-score (Y axis) values for different threshold values (X axis) can be visualized from the curve below:
