### 1. Brief Introduction
 The [`Deep Banding Index Paper ADD Link`](https://2021.ieeeicassp.org/) introduces [first of its kind dataset: Add links](https://2021.ieeeicassp.org/), [first of its kind dataset: Add links2](https://2021.ieeeicassp.org/) and an Objective Assesment of Banding quantification in HD images with Deep Banding Index, which aims to capture the annoyance caused to end users (QoE) as they percieve media featuring Banding Artifacts.

#### 1.1 Backgrounds
Banding, colour banding, or false contours is a common visual artifact appearing in images and videos, often in large regions of low textures and slow gradients such as sky. When the granularity of bit-depth or display intensity levels mismatches with the visual systemâ€™s perception of the smooth transition of color and luminance presented in the image content,the discontinuity positions in smooth image gradients are transformed into perceivable, wide, discrete bands. Banding significantly deteriorates the perceptual quality-of-experience(QoE) of end users. A visual example is shown in the image below where banding artifacts are clearly visible in the sky.

### 2. Dataset
- The Dataset is generated by extracting frames from more than 600 pristine high-definition (HD) videos, resulting in approximately 1,250+ images of 19201080 resolution. Banding distortion is be introduced by bit-depth reduction (or dynamic range tone mapping) in luma and chroma channels of image/ video (where bit-depth reduction can also leads to other perceptually visible artifacts). 
- Six levels of quantization are used to enhance the diversity of the dataset, The generation of quantized image frames is explained in [`Data Generation From Pristine Videos`](Dataset-Generation/)
